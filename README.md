Experiments for categories and relation algebra in Julia

I've fiddled with some examples or category theory feeling things before:

http://www.philipzucker.com/grobner-bases-and-optics/ - Polynomial relations solved via resultant or grobner basis is an interesting way to do optics or hamilton-jacobi mechanics

## Julia Stuff

Catlab seems like it implements useful functionality somewhat reminiscient of Conal Elliott's Compiling to Categories
